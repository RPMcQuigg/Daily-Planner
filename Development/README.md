# Daily-Planner

HTML - Removed the Past, Present, and Future classes for each time block and just created a block for every hour betwwen 9AM and 5PM.

CSS - Unchanged

JS - Added code for showing the current date, showing current time period and changing color for the proper time block, and saving user date for each time block to the local storage. Was UNABLE to test applications ability to change color for the proper time block due to finishing application outside of the display period on the page.
